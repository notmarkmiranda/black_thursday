# DTR - Black Thursday

* What are your learning goals for this project?
  * Mark: data manipulation to deliver real results
  * Jeneve: get good at refactoring and enumerables (getting rid of each)


* What is your collaboration style? How do you feel about pair programming vs. divide-and-conquer approaches?
  * J: open to both methods, think it’ll be a combination of both. more effective together, a lot of opportunities for separate work
  * M: open to both, helping each other learn in weak areas


* How do you communicate best? How do you appreciate receiving communication from others?
  * J: written communication, not in code. verbal, not have things taken away. integrate feedback on the fly
  *M: written or vebal, fine either way, just tell me if i’m being an asshole


* How would you describe your work style?
  *  J: Still developing, frequently and stop typing and draw pictures/write in notebook. a lot to do with uncomfortable with computer environment
  * M: Physical views of responsibilites and flow. Mentally work out roadblocks


* What’s gone well or poorly in your last projects?
  * J: last project went really smoothly, 1 bonus: had grandparent coverage, but not this time. open conversation about when and if to work on it.
  * M: keeping  lines of communication open regarding work styles or problem solving


* What do you need (resources, environment, communication) to do your best work?
  * J: work after schooltime: handy to be available on slack after ~8
  * M: milestones to make sure we’re on track


* What scheduling restraints do you have? What are your scheduling preferences?
  * J: out after school at 4pm, online ~8 (could potentially work in the morning)
  * M: openly available until ~ 11pm (could potentially work in the morning)


* What is your style for giving feedback? Does anything ever hold you back from giving feedback?
  * J: “just tell you to your face at the moment”
  * M: “just tell you to your face at the moment”


* What do you identify as being your biggest strength(s) technically, as they relate to this project?
  * M: focused on TDD, good with iteration, fairly organized with splitting responsibilities
  * J: focused on TDD, pretty good at breaking down a problem logically


* Where do you feel you could use improvement in your technical skills, as they relate to this project?
  * J: Big time on workflow stuff: typing, shortcuts, navigating
  * M: vocalizing and explaining ideas in my head in a way people can understand


* How can our team help support you in improving these skills?
  * J: Tell you when I need further explanation on something.
  * M: I’ll force you not to use your trackpad and give suggestions on working faster


* What tools do you want to use to manage the project?
Waffle.io How do you want the group to solve problems when members run into issues with features of the project?
  * M: initially together, then divide and conquer if we hit a wall.
  * J: less fearful of merge conflicts


* How do you know if a project is successful? How can we achieve that as a group?
  * M: pass module 1, ideally: i’d like to finish all of the iterations, achieve baseline by tuesday, time to refactor and not be rushed
  * J: pass module 1(baseline), excited to invent our own features, clean code (syntax and style), I’d like to be able to walk through every part of the code
